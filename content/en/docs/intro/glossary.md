This glossary contains general and technical terms that are proprietary to the QuanXiang Cloud Platform.

## API

Application Programming Interface, the application encapsulates its own service capabilities into an API and opens it to user calls.


## API group

The API group is the management unit of the API, and the API provider manages all the APIs within the API group as a unit; the API group needs to be created before creating the API.



## API Key

The API key is a unique identifier that is used for authentication and securing API access.



## Third-Party API Proxy

You can register/invoke third-party APIs through the QuanXiang Cloud Platform. Based on the transparent proxy and security authentication mechanism of QuanXiang Cloud Platform, it realizes many heterogeneous features such as security authentication and protocol differences for users to hide the third-party APIs.




## Log

Log is an abstract data of changes in the system operation, its content is an ordered collection of operations of specified objects and their operation results by time.



## Webhook

Webhook is an API concept, one of the paradigms for the use of microservices APIs, also known as reverse APIs, where the front-end does not actively send requests, but is pushed entirely by the back-end. As a common example, if your friend sends a friend message, the backend pushes the message to all other friends' clients, which is a typical scenario for Webhook.



## Microservices

Micraservice is an architecture for developing applications that decompose large applications into multiple independent components, where each component performs the corresponding function. When a user request is processed, a microservices-based application may invoke other internal microservices to process it together.





## Cloud Native

Cloud-native technologies enable organizations to build and run elastic and scalable applications in new dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Representative technologies for cloud-native include containers, service networks, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs.(from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
