All Elephant Cloud Platform around the application design, development, deployment, operation and maintenance of the whole life cycle management. It builds a low-code ecology and empowers the information technology digital intelligence construction for enterprises.  The core capabilities of the platform are as follows: 

## Application Development

- Quick build forms: With the form designer, you can quickly drag and drop the required form pages. The form designer supports a wide range of basic and advanced components to cover most form application scenarios.
- Workflow building: You can quickly build the required process based on the workflow module. Through some basic node components such as approval node, data update node, etc., build business approval process or system automatic processing process.
- Design custom pages: With the custom page designer, you can build the WEB pages your business needs. You can add interaction logic and data presentation to the page by using data sources, events and some simple functions.
- Data source management: Support managing the data of incremental system and inventory system.
  - Incremental systems perform data management by creating data models.
  - The inventory system can be connected to the existing system through the proxy and orchestration of API to transfer data and obtain the required data. It can transfer and consume data through page level, support secondary development of components and page functions, and realize pluggable embedding into the stock system for use.
- Permission management: Support application role grouping management, fine control of the application page access and data access security rights to protect the application data security.

## Multi-use of applications

Platform applications can be designed at one time and flexibly adapted to multiple ends, supporting publishing as WEB applications, APP and WeChat applets.



## Platform Deployment

- QuanXiang Cloud Platform based on Kubernetes containerized deployment solution, CI/CD continuous delivery deployment, for the smooth deployment and stable operation of the application escort. It greatly reduces the risk and complexity of iterative upgrades after the application is launched.
- Supports native Kubernetes and KubeSphere deployments and operations.
