### Explanation of terms

- FaaS: "Function as a Service" is an event-driven computing execution model that runs in stateless containers. FaaS provides developers with an abstract way to run applications that respond to events without the need to manage servers.
- Intelligent dispatching: Each company understands it differently, so here is an example. In order to ensure that each driver and each vehicle achieves an average workload in a fixed cycle, we also combine comprehensive factors such as car maintenance and repair, number restrictions, and drivers' personal leave transfer and physical condition to carry out the mechanism of automatic system allocation of vehicles and drivers.
