Enterprise applications usually require multi-role user collaboration, and when collecting or analyzing data, it is necessary to control the resources accessible to different users to avoid system risk problems caused by the lack of permission control or improper operation.

QuanXiang Cloud Platform divides application permissions into access side permissions and management side permissions, and realizes split-end management of application permissions.





## Config Portal

[Console Application Management](https://portal.quanxiang.dev/apps) > **Application Specific** > **Access Control**.

## Configure console permissions

Console permissions can add an administrator for the application. This member can design and manage the application, can access any form of the application, and has all operation permissions, field management, and data management permissions.

Click **Configure Console Permissions** > **Add Administrator** to add an application administrator.

## Remove Console Permissions

If the employee's position has changed, you need to remove the employee's application management privileges. Click **Remove** in the action column of the employee's information.

## Configure access permissions

Access-side permissions support configuring permissions by subdividing the application dimensions to achieve fine-grained management of permissions. Permission management dimensions are **worksheet** > **operation permission**, **field permission**, **data permission**.

- Worksheet permissions: Once configured, users can access the form at [access side](https://home.quanxiang.dev).
- After completing the configuration of operation permission, field permission and data permission of the form, the user can perform the permission permit operation.



### Initialize permission groups

The initialization permission group is generated by the system, and the application creator belongs to the initialization permission group by default and has the highest permission for application management. You can access any form of the application and have all operation privileges, field management, and data management privileges.
