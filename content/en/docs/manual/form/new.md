## Define

In QuanXiang Cloud Platform you can build data table models through form visualization and correspond directly to field types through controls. Implement the necessary relational data structures through linked sheets, linked sheet fields and summaries.

## Explanation of terms

- **Component**: For the specification and correct input of field data, the QuanXiang Cloud system pre-sets some formatted field types.
- **Field**: A single piece of data in a data sheet that stores data for a certain attribute, such as: name, age, address, etc.
- **Sheet**: Used to store and manage various business object data in enterprise activities. You can securely store and manage this data in the QuanXiang Cloud Platform.
- **Record**: When a data sheet is completed, a record is generated that contains data from multiple fields in the sheet.

## Usage Scenario

Forms are widely used in business data collection scenarios. For example: employee forms, customer forms, order forms, sales forms, inventory forms, product forms, work order forms, etc.
